    <h2>I am an artist from Northwest Ohio.</h2>
    <p>I first started painting only 6 years ago when I took a tole painting class. I was the youngest person in that class by about 30 years! But I fell in love with painting and pushed myself to explore  other art styles and to work in a variety of mediums. One of my favorites is watercolor. I love to paint and draw floral and botanical subjects. Flowers are my favorite thing to paint because they are all so natural and different, it is hard to paint a terrible flower! Everywhere I go, I am taking pictures of flowers to draw or paint later. I am an avid gardner, and I love photographing flowers from my own yard.</p>
    <p>I believe that art needs to be shared. My favorite thing to do is to paint cards for every and all occasion. My most ambitious card was a pop-up watercolor card for a baby shower. Cards are just better when they are handmade, which is why I choose to make cards for everyone, for everything. I also enjoy painting on unconventional surfaces (shoes, bags, household items - nothing is off limits from my paintbrush!).
    <p>When I am not painting, I am usually found gardening in my yard, reading or nerding out with my husband, Aaron.</p>
